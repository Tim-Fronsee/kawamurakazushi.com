## Introduction

I want to set some personal goals for 2019.

I think Goals are important.
It makes you focus, and challenges you to meet those goals.

It's even better when it's visible, like this blog post, although no one is actually reading this.
It gives me more responsibility than just writing it down in my notepad.

So there are two elements that I want to work on.

First is **Personal Growth / Branding** and the second is **Memories**.

## Personal Growth / Branding

I think there are many ways to improve your personal growth and branding.

But these are 4 concrete goals that I want to accomplish in 2019.

### 1. Blog Posting

Simple but one of the best way to output your knowledge.

I won't set up a concrete number of goals yet, but I will try to write what I learned as much as possible.

I won't write a perfect blog post, I will just write it consistently.

### 2. Release an App

Currently in my free time, I'm building an Application with Flutter/Dart, Crystal, Elm and Firebase.

All of the technologies are new to me and super interesting to learn.

Same as the blog post, but done is better than perfect. I must release it.

### 3. PSM I (Professional Scrum Master I)

PSM I if a certificate to prove your knowledge in scrum.

Recently at my company we implemented scrum, in our management.

It's a really interesting tool to use, and I wanted to go deeper but didn't know where to start.

I'm not a huge fan of certificates, but it might it be a good milestone, to get some basic understanding of the whole picture.

### 4. Clothing

This is completely non-technical. But I want some better clothes.

Something I will really enjoy wearing, but minimal.

It's part of personal branding :)

## Memories

I don't take a lot of photos in general.

But when I look back, it's a quite sad not to leave anything for the future to remember. Although there is lots of scenes and fantastic moments that I don't want to forget.

I also thought about diaries but I knew it will be hard for me to continue so I will start taking photos and video!

First step will be buying a camera. [Osmo Pocket](https://www.dji.com/jp/osmo-pocket) or [Go Pro Hero 7 Black](https://jp.shop.gopro.com/APAC/cameras/hero7-black/CHDHX-701-master.html)

## Summary

I will try to accomplish what I wrote here, and it will be great if i can write my retrospective of 2019 in this blog.

Nothing much to summarize.
